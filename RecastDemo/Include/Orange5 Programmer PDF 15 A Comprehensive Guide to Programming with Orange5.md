Orange-5 Programmer comes with a base software that can be downloaded from the official website[^1^]. The base software includes a set of additional tools such as logic analyzer, oscilloscope, generator, probe, and emulator[^1^]. The base software also supports some EEPROMs and MCUs such as MTRK and TMS[^1^]. However, some functions and adapters are not included in the base software and require additional paid software licenses[^1^]. For example, to work with Motorola and Renesas MCUs, users need to purchase separate software licenses[^1^].
 
Orange-5 Programmer is compatible with Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, and 10 operating systems. It requires a USB 2.0 cable to connect to the PC. Users can order Orange-5 Programmer or any of its products through the distributors listed on the website[^1^]. Users can also find installation guides, manuals, FAQs, and contacts on the website[^1^]. Users can also join the forum to communicate with other locksmiths and get support[^1^].
 
Orange-5 Programmer is a versatile and powerful device that can meet the needs of professionals who work with memory and microcontrollers. It offers flexibility, functionality, and reliability for various programming tasks.

## Features and Functions of Orange-5 Programmer
 
Orange-5 Programmer has a universal panel ZIF16 for EEPROMs that can easily plug and unplug the ICs. It also has two expansion sockets (MT and SE) for additional adapters. It has protection against overcurrent and overload voltage to prevent damage to the device and the ICs. It has three adjustable voltage and current control: power supply voltage (2.0-5.0V), programming voltage (2.0-21.0V), and additional static 10V for microcontrollers. It has high-speed bidirectional pin drivers with adjustable voltage (2.0-5.0V) that can work with various ICs. It has a wave cycle generator with frequency (up to 24 MHz) and output voltage (2.0-5.0V) adjustment that can generate different signals for testing and programming. It has a built-in 32-bit virtual machine that can execute the protocols written in the macrolanguage.
 
Orange-5 Programmer supports various interfaces such as I2C, SPI, MicroWire, JTAG, UART, BDM, ISO7816, K-LINE, and CAN. It can work with different types of memory such as EEPROMs, FLASHs, EPROMs, and RAMs. It can also work with different types of microcontrollers such as AVR, PIC, STM32, MSP430, 8051, Z80, and others. It can read, write, verify, erase, copy, compare, edit, encrypt, decrypt, and calculate checksums for the memory and microcontrollers. It can also perform some special functions such as immobilizer reset, airbag reset, mileage correction, ECU cloning, key programming, and others.
 
## Examples of Using Orange-5 Programmer
 
Here are some examples of how to use Orange-5 Programmer for different programming tasks:
 
- To program an EEPROM with I2C interface, users need to connect the EEPROM to the ZIF16 socket or use an adapter if needed. Then they need to select the EEPROM type from the software menu and click on Read or Write button to perform the operation.
- To program a MCU with JTAG interface, users need to connect the MCU to the MT socket or use an adapter if needed. Then they need to select the MCU type from the software menu and click on Connect button to establish communication. Then they can use the software functions such as Read Flash, Write Flash, Erase Flash, Verify Flash, etc.
- To program a MCU with UART interface, users need to connect the MCU to the SE socket or use an adapter if needed. Then they need to select the MCU type from the software menu and click on Connect button to establish communication. Then they can use the software functions such as Read Memory, Write Memory, Erase Memory, Verify Memory, etc.
- To program a key for a car immobilizer system, users need to connect the key transponder to the ZIF16 socket or use an adapter if needed. Then they need to select the car model from the software menu and click on Program Key button to perform the operation.

These are just some examples of how to use Orange-5 Programmer for different programming tasks. Users can find more information and instructions on how to use Orange-5 Programmer for various applications on the website or on the forum.
